# Product Context: Aiglon Futé Dashboard

## Why this project exists
The project aims to provide air traffic control (ATC) personnel at LFLL (Lyon St Exupéry) with a tool to analyze control capacity, forecast traffic load, identify congestion points, and verify planning compliance. The existing system relies on manual data processing and lacks dynamic, interactive capabilities.

## Problems it solves
*   **Manual Capacity Assessment**: Replaces manual calculations of ATC capacity based on planned staffing.
*   **Proactive Congestion Identification**: Helps detect time slots where traffic demand might exceed control capacity, allowing for proactive adjustments.
*   **Regulatory Compliance Check**: Ensures agent schedules adhere to Alpha/Beta rules, reducing compliance risks.
*   **Lack of Interactivity**: Transforms static data analysis into a dynamic, user-driven exploration tool.

## How it should work
The enhanced dashboard should allow users to:
*   Load COHOR traffic data.
*   Select specific date ranges and days of the week for analysis.
*   Dynamically adjust parameters related to control capacity (e.g., SIV hypothesis, active vacation profiles).
*   Visualize the calculated control capacity overlaid with traffic data on an interactive chart.
*   View summary statistics and compliance reports.

## User experience goals
*   **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use controls for data loading and parameter adjustment.
*   **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate updates to charts and statistics upon user interaction.
*   **Clarity**: Clear visualization of capacity vs. traffic, highlighting potential issues.
*   **Efficiency**: Streamline the process of capacity analysis and planning verification.
